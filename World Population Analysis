# Analysis of World Population
The dataset contains the population statistics of all countries and continents from 1970 to 2022.

## Load the Necessary packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

## Import the data and clean it

```{r}
world_population <- read_csv("/kaggle/input/world-population-dataset/world_population.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
world_population$Continent <- as.factor(world_population$Continent)
levels(world_population$Continent)
```

We just changed the continent column into a facor with each continent as levels. This will allow for easy grouping.

### Largest and smallest countries in the world

```{r}
large <- world_population %>%  arrange(desc(`2022 Population`))
head(large)
```

The Six Largest countries in the world are China, India, US, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Nigeria.

```{r}
small <- world_population %>% arrange(`2022 Population`)
head(small)
```

The Six smallest countries in the world are Vatican City, Tokelau, Niue, Falkland Islands, Monsterrat, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon.

### Percentage increase in Population from 1970 to 2022 by country

```{r}
new_column <- mutate(world_population, percent_change = round(((`2022 Population` - `1970 Population`)/ `1970 Population`) * 100))
per_increase <- new_column %>% select(`Country/Territory`, Continent, `2022 Population`, `1970 Population`, percent_change) %>% 
  arrange(desc(percent_change))
head(per_increase)
```

The United Arab Emirates experienced the largest population increase from 1970 to 2022 rising over 3000%. The reasons for this are not examined in this analysis. 5 out of the top 6 countries with the highest percentage increase are located in Africa or Asia.

### Countries with least increase in population during this same period.

```{r}
new_column %>% select(`Country/Territory`, Continent, `2022 Population`, `1970 Population`, percent_change) %>% arrange(percent_change)
```

Some countries like the Vatican, Latvia and Georgia saw a decrease in their populations.

The total world population is:

```{r}
sum(world_population$`2022 Population`)
```

#### Population by continent

```{r}
total_pop <- world_population %>% group_by(Continent) %>% summarise(
  sum_2022 = sum(`2022 Population`),
  sum_2020 = sum(`2020 Population`),
  sum_2015 = sum(`2015 Population`),
  sum_2010 = sum(`2010 Population`),
  sum_2000 = sum(`2000 Population`),
  sum_1990 = sum(`1990 Population`),
  sum_1980 = sum(`1980 Population`),
  sum_1970 = sum(`1970 Population`)
)
head(total_pop)
```

We can graph it in a bar chart by continent

```{r}
ggplot(data = total_pop) + geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Continent, y = sum_2022, fill = Continent)) +
  ggtitle('Total World Population by Continent') + labs(x = 'Continent', y = 'Population')
```

### Continent by growth rate from 1970-2022

```{r}
cont_growth <- total_pop %>% mutate(percent_change = ((sum_2022 - sum_1970)/sum_1970) * 100) %>% arrange(desc(percent_change))
head(cont_growth)
```

We can also graph this.

```{r}
ggplot(data = cont_growth) + geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Continent, y = percent_change, fill = Continent)) + ggtitle('Population Growth from 1970 to 2022 by Continent', subtitle = 'In Percentages') + labs(x = 'Continent', y = 'Growth rate(%)')
```

Though Asia is the most populous continent, Africa has experienced the fastest population growth of all continents from 1970 to 2022. Europe has experienced the least growth. This has many implications for the globe as governments in Africa will have to cater to the needs of a rapidly increasing population.
